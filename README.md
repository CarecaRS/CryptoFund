# CryptoFund

This is an approach to a cryptocurrencies fund using Binance as the exchange and an user-defined number of assets to invest in, based on the top 20 crypto pairs traded over Binance, using exclusively Python (version 3.13.3 at the time of this writing). The 'top 20' classification is based on the biggest market cap assets, get from CoinMarketCap.com.

The main file is coded using Jupyter Notebook for the ease of use by the newcomers. If you decide to put it into production (trading with actual money) I advise you to transform this file to a simple Python script (foo.py)
